The problem: Calculation for lower amount of steps to transform s1 to s2

### What could metric be used for

Could be used 
- Efficiency measurement for previous
- Difference calculator for two different strings
- Cost calculator if the insert is heavier than delete or vise versa

### The idea

Finding s1 (or parts of s1) inside s2
